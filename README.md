# EGI Accounting Portal Source code
The EGI Accounting Repository receives data from APEL and ultimately from sites participating in the EGI and WLCG infrastructures as well as from sites belonging to other Grid organisations that are collaborating with EGI. This is crossed with metadata from other sources to offer a integrated view of accounting data on the EGI Infrastructure.
